# veritable-cloudagent
Thanks to the -> https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext/tree/main. This is a forket version that is primary focused on https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext/tree/main/packages/rest `package`

## Valuable Info
Currently using `yarn` package manager due to the need of workspaces so this monolith repo can function. Did attempt `npm` and `package.json -> workspaces` with the syntax for npm but could not get it working and also sounds like a follow up story

## Getting Start
```sh
yarn install
```

## TODO https://digicatapult.atlassian.net/browse/VER-51
- [ ] Adopt our prettier linting convention
- [x] add open-source materials
- [x] do not upgrade dependencies and donâ€™t implement renovate yet
- [x] workflows for running tests in CI and releasing
- [x] ensure attribution is acknowledged
