# Make sure we're not running multiple release steps at the same time as this can give issues with determining the next npm version to release.
# Ideally we only add this to the 'release' job so it doesn't limit PR runs, but github can't guarantee the job order in that case:
# "When concurrency is specified at the job level, order is not guaranteed for jobs or runs that queue within 5 minutes of each other."
